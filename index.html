    <p><strong>Lionel Andrés Messi</strong>[note 1] (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (listen); born 24
        June 1987), also known as <strong> Leo Messi</strong>, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a
        forward and captains the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,
        Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he
        was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional
        career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey
        titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the
        2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La
        Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga
        (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (103). Messi
        has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single
        club (672). <br><br>

        Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged
        17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and
        in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football;
        that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four
        consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he
        set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as
        Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind
        Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign,
        becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he
        was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth
        Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two
        seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. <br><br>

        An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national
        record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament
        with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of
        play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described
        Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and
        score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young
        player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals:
        the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball, and
        the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led
        his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and
        victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. For this
        achievement, Messi received a record-extending seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the
        2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final,
        and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26). <br><br>

        Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's
        highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid
        athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011,
        2012 and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with Messi being the
        first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi became the second footballer and second team-sport
        athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.</p>
    <h1 id="rona">Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
    <div class="ron"></div>
    <p><strong> Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM </strong>(Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu];
        born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi
        Professional League club <strong>Al Nassr</strong> and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the
        greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes,
        the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA
        Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. <strong>Ronaldo</strong> holds
        the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the
        European Championship (14), international goals (123) and international appearances (200). He is one of the few
        players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career
        goals for club and country, making him the highest goalscorer of all time. He is the only player to score in
        five different FIFA World Cup tournaments. <br><br>

        Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA
        Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions
        League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the
        then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94
        million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth
        Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima.
        During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was
        runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top
        goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for
        six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga
        titles, two Copas del Rey, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a
        transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a
        player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became
        the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the
        English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season
        as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr. <br><br>

        Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned 200 caps, making
        him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the all-time top
        goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal
        at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008.
        In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The
        following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot
        as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon
        d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award
        in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. <br><br>

        One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by
        Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on
        their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third
        sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.</p>
    <h1 id="ronaldin">Ronaldinho</h1>
    <div class="ronal"></div>
    <p><strong> Ronaldo de Assis Moreira</strong> (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as <strong>Ronaldinho Gaúcho</strong>  (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʁonawˈdʒĩɲu ɡaˈuʃu]) or simply <strong>Ronaldinho</strong> ,[note 1] is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but was also deployed as a winger. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. He is the only player ever to have won a World Cup, a Copa América, a Confederations Cup, a Champions League, a Copa Libertadores and a Ballon d'Or.[4] A global icon of the sport, Ronaldinho was renowned for his technical skills, creativity, dribbling ability and accuracy from free-kicks, his use of tricks, feints, no-look passes and overhead kicks, as well as his ability to score and create goals, all prominent characteristics of his early-age background playing futsal. He is known by the nickname "<strong>O Bruxo</strong> " ("The Wizard").[5][6] <br><br>

        Ronaldinho made his career debut for Grêmio, in 1998. At age 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award as Barcelona won the 2004–05 La Liga title. The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, their first in fourteen years, and another La Liga title, giving Ronaldinho his first career double, receiving the 2005 Ballon d'Or and his second FIFA World Player of the Year in the process. After scoring two spectacular solo goals in the first 2005–06 El Clásico, Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu. <br><br>
        
        Following a second-place La Liga finish to Real Madrid in the 2006–07 season and an injury-plagued 2007–08 season, Ronaldinho suffered a decline in his performances—often put down to a decrease in dedication and focus having achieved so much in the sport—and departed Barcelona to join AC Milan, where he won the 2010–11 Serie A. He returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atlético Mineiro a year later where he won the 2013 Copa Libertadores, before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015. Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career: he was included in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times each, and was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year for the 2005–06 season and South American Footballer of the Year in 2013; in 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players. <br><br>
        
        In his international career with Brazil, Ronaldinho earned 97 caps and scored 33 goals and represented his country in two FIFA World Cups. After debuting with the Seleção by winning the 1999 Copa América, he was an integral part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning team, starring alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking trio, and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. As captain, he led his team to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup title and was named man of the match in the final. He also captained the Brazil Olympic team to a bronze medal in men's football at the 2008 Summer Olympics.</p>
        <h1 id="roberto">Roberto Carlos</h1>
        <div class="rober"></div>
        <p><strong>Roberto Carlos da Silva Rocha </strong> (born 10 April 1973), often known as <strong>Roberto Carlos</strong>  and sometimes as RC3[note 1] is a Brazilian former professional footballer who currently works as a football ambassador.[4] He started his career in Brazil as a forward but spent most of his career as a left-back and has been described as the "most offensive-minded left-back in the history of the game".[5] A free kick specialist throughout his career, his bending shots have measured at over 105 miles per hour (169 km/h).[6][7] In 1997, he was runner-up in the FIFA World Player of the Year. Widely considered one of the greatest full-backs and left-backs in history, in 2004 he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[8][9][10] <br><br>

            At club level, Roberto Carlos joined Real Madrid from Inter Milan in 1996 to spend 11 highly successful seasons, playing 584 matches in all competitions and scoring 71 goals. At Real, he won four La Liga titles and the UEFA Champions League three times. In April 2013, Marca named him in their "Best Foreign Eleven in Real Madrid's History".[11] He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances at club and international level. <br><br>
            
            Roberto Carlos made his debut for the Brazil national team in 1992. He played in three World Cups, helping the team reach the final in 1998 in France, and win the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. He was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team in 1998 and 2002. With Brazil he is especially known for a bending 40-yard free kick against France in the inaugural match of Tournoi de France 1997. With 125 caps he has made the third-most appearances for his national team.[12] He was chosen on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in a 2002 FIFA poll. <br><br>
            
            He took up management and was named as the manager of Sivasspor in the Turkish Süper Lig in June 2013.[13] He resigned as head coach in December 2014.[14] From January to June 2015, he was manager of Akhisarspor. Although Roberto Carlos announced his retirement from playing at the age of 39 in 2012,[15] in July 2015 he was appointed player/manager of Indian Super League club Delhi Dynamos, with whom he would make three appearances.[16]</p>
